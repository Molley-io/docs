## Best Practices

Clear goals guide everything:

- What's the timeline?

### 2. Know Your Audience

Deep audience understanding:

- Who are they?
- What do they care about?
- Where do they spend time?
- What motivates action?

### 3. Be Specific

Vague plans don't get executed:

- Specific tactics, not just strategies
- Clear owners and deadlines
- Measurable success criteria

### 4. Plan for Iteration

Marketing is iterative:

- Build in review points
- Plan to test and learn
- Be ready to adjust

### 5. Connect to Business Goals

Marketing supports business objectives:

- How does this drive revenue?
- How does this support growth?
- What's the ROI expectation?
