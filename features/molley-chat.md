# Molley Chat

Your AI assistant that already knows your business — no copy-pasting, no context-switching, just answers.

## The Problem

Every time you use ChatGPT or another AI tool, you face the same frustrating ritual:

1. **Copy your company description** — "We're a B2B SaaS that helps..."
2. **Paste your product details** — "Our main features are..."
3. **Explain your target audience** — "We sell to mid-market..."
4. **Add the actual question** — Finally, what you actually wanted to ask

And then you do it all again for the next question. And the next. Every. Single. Time.

**Your context is scattered across documents, your AI doesn't remember anything, and you waste precious minutes on setup instead of getting answers.**

## The Solution

Molley Chat is an AI assistant that's always connected to your company and project context. It knows:

- **Your company** — Name, description, industry, target market
- **Your products** — Features, positioning, value propositions
- **Your projects** — Goals, requirements, research findings
- **Your documents** — Wiki pages, research notes, feature specs

When you ask a question, Molley already has the context. No pasting. No explaining. Just ask.

## How It Works

### Always-On Context

Open Molley Chat from anywhere in the app. Your current company and project context is automatically loaded:

1. Click the **Molley Chat** button (bottom-right corner)
2. Start typing your question
3. Get contextually relevant answers immediately

The chat header shows your active context — company and project — so you always know what Molley knows.

### Add Project Context

Working on a specific project? Add it to the conversation:

1. Click **Add Project To Chat** in the header
2. Select the project from the dropdown
3. Molley now has access to that project's details, wiki, and research

Remove the project context anytime by clicking the **×** next to the project name.

### Load Specific Documents

Need Molley to reference a particular document? Use the **Context Button** available throughout the app:

- On Research Notes — Load the note content
- On Wiki Pages — Load the wiki content
- On Feature Ideas — Load the feature details
- On Outreach Tools — Load the tool guide

The loaded context appears as a highlighted message in the chat, so you can see exactly what Molley is working with.

## Collaborative Conversations

### The Pain of Solo AI Chats

Traditional AI chats are isolated. When a colleague asks "What did the AI say about our pricing strategy?", you're stuck:

- Screenshotting conversations
- Copy-pasting responses into Slack
- Losing the thread of the discussion
- No shared memory across the team

### Add People to Your Chat

Molley Chat supports **multi-user conversations**. Bring your team into the discussion:

1. Click the **Add People** button in the chat header
2. Select team members from your company
3. They can now see and contribute to the conversation

**Use cases:**

- **Strategy sessions** — Brainstorm with AI and colleagues together
- **Knowledge sharing** — Let the team see AI-generated insights
- **Async collaboration** — Team members can continue the conversation later
- **Onboarding** — New team members can review past AI discussions

### Who Can Add Participants

- **Thread owners** can add and remove participants
- **Participants** can view and contribute but not manage membership
- **Company members only** — Participants must be part of your company

## Example Conversations

### Product Strategy

> **You:** What positioning would work best for our enterprise tier?
>
> **Molley:** Based on your company profile targeting mid-market B2B SaaS and your current feature set focusing on automation, I'd suggest positioning around "Enterprise-grade automation without enterprise complexity." Your research notes mention that prospects often cite implementation time as a concern — lean into your faster time-to-value...

### Content Creation

> **You:** Write a LinkedIn post announcing our new integration
>
> **Molley:** Here's a draft based on your brand voice and the integration details from your product wiki:
>
> "🚀 Big news: [Product] now integrates with [Partner]!
>
> For teams already using both tools, this means..."

### Research Analysis

> **You:** Summarize the key themes from our recent customer interviews
>
> **Molley:** Looking at your research notes from the past month, I see three recurring themes:
>
> 1. **Onboarding friction** — 4 of 6 interviews mentioned...
> 2. **Feature discovery** — Users aren't finding...
> 3. **Pricing clarity** — Questions about...

## Tips for Better Conversations

### Be Specific

Instead of: "Help me with marketing"

Try: "Write 3 email subject lines for our Q1 product launch targeting enterprise buyers"

### Reference Your Data

Instead of: "What should our roadmap look like?"

Try: "Based on our feature ideas and customer feedback, what should we prioritize next quarter?"

### Use Follow-ups

Molley remembers the conversation. Build on previous responses:

1. "Analyze our competitor positioning"
2. "Now suggest how we can differentiate"
3. "Turn that into a one-liner for our homepage"

### Add Context When Needed

If you're discussing something specific, load it first:

1. Navigate to the relevant document
2. Click the **Context** button to load it into chat
3. Then ask your question
