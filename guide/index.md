# Introduction to Molley

Welcome to Molley — your all-in-one platform for research, product development, and business growth.

## What is Molley?

Molley is a comprehensive product development platform that brings together:

- **Research tools** for capturing insights and synthesizing data
- **Product management** with wikis, feature tracking, and Kanban boards
- **Growth tools** including CRM, outreach planning, and marketing
- **Feedback collection** with embeddable forms
- **AI assistance** that understands your entire business context

Unlike traditional tools that work in isolation, Molley connects everything together. When you're working on a feature, the AI knows about your company, your project, and all related context — without any manual setup.

## Core Concepts

### Companies

A **Company** in Molley represents your organization or business. It's the top-level container for all your work. You can:

- Create multiple companies (useful for consultants or agencies)
- Invite team members to collaborate
- Configure company-wide settings and branding

### Projects

Within each company, you create **Projects** — these represent individual products, services, or initiatives. Each project has its own:

- Research notes and knowledge base
- Feature ideas and Kanban boards
- Bug tracking
- Growth and marketing tools
- Feedback forms

### The AI Advantage

What makes Molley unique is how the AI assistant works. When you chat with Molley AI:

- **At company level**: It knows your company profile, culture, and overall strategy
- **At project level**: It also knows your product details, target audience, and goals
- **At feature level**: It understands the specific feature, its requirements, and how it fits into your product

This contextual awareness means you get relevant, informed assistance without having to explain your business every time.
