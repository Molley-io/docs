# Molley AI Overview

Molley AI is your intelligent assistant that understands your business context and helps you work more effectively.

## What Makes Molley AI Different?

Unlike generic AI assistants, Molley AI knows about:

- **Your company** — Mission, values, target market, positioning
- **Your projects** — Products, features, target audience, goals
- **Your content** — Research, documentation, features, feedback

This means you get relevant, contextual assistance without having to explain your business every time.

## How Context Works

### Automatic Context Loading

When you open Molley Chat, it automatically loads relevant context based on where you are:

| Location | Context Loaded |
|----------|----------------|
| Company level | Company profile, culture, strategy |
| Project level | + Project details, target audience |
| Feature level | + Feature description, requirements |
| Research | + Related research notes |

### Context Indicators

The chat interface shows what context is loaded:

- **Company context** — Your company information
- **Project context** — Current project details
- **Feature context** — Specific feature information
- **Custom context** — Content you've added manually

### Adding Custom Context

You can add specific content to the conversation:

1. Find any item (feature, note, research)
2. Click the **Molley** button
3. Select **Add to Chat**
4. The content is added as context
