- **The item** — What you're working on
- **Related content** — Connected items

### Why This Matters

Generic AI:
> "Here's a feature description for user authentication..."

Molley AI:
> "Based on your B2B SaaS product targeting enterprise customers who value security, here's a feature description for user authentication that emphasizes compliance and SSO support..."
